Lecture Notes and related information for CSC 346, Enterprise Computing in Java

## Outline

(Preliminary)

### Unit 00 -- Review

This material is intended to catch people up to the same level.  It will be presented before class starts.

This material will not be tested explicitly, but it will be background for everything in the course.  It establishes the skills I expect everyone has when starting the course.

There will be two simple assignments.  Technically the assignments will be due a week after class starts, but I am hoping most students will do them before the first day of classes.

* Up and running
  * Getting Java updated to a current LTS version
  * IDEs
  * Reading from a file.  Handling exceptions.
  * Reading from a URL. More on exceptions.  Exceptions as a model for Inheritance
  * Consulting Java APIs
  * Very basic Github
* Objects
  * Creating Objects.  
  * Arrays of Objects
  
### Unit 01 -- Inheritance and Java Mechanics 

Some of this material will be covered quickly.  A lot of it should still be review.
