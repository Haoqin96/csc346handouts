# 01.050 POJOs

## Plain Old Java Object

A POJO is a "Plain old Java Object."  

It usually relates to something that is a real-world object or entity.  

## Standard features/structure

* The object is in its own file.  It is usually public.
* All data fields are private
* There are getters and setters using standard format
  * Getters may be "is" format for booleans values
* Uses standard format constructors
  * Some standards have them set directly
  * Preference for this class is to call setters rather than setting values directly
* toString() is defined
* default compareTo() is defined if there is a logical default comparator
* equals() and hashCode() are defined according to the "Java Contract."
  * Generally these should be set up with automatically by the IDE using generated code.

### Local variations for this course

    * implement Compararable<self-Object> interface
    * Use setters in constructors

##  Onward to Java Beans

A JavaBean is a POJO with a couple of extra features

* Implements the Serializable interface
* Has a noArg constructor
  * Sometimes this requirement is suspended

The intent of JavaBeans is to allow data to be transferred between applications

Frameworks like Spring expect proper JavaBeans.
