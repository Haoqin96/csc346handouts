## Jsoup

[https://jsoup.org/](https://jsoup.org/)

* Jsoup is a package that makes it relatively easy to fetch and parse web pages.
* Web pages are parsed into DOM in the same way that modern browsers do.
* We can parse the page using the [CSS selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)
  * ids start with the # symbol
  * classes start with periods.

## Using Jsoup

* Create a basic Java project in your ide.
* Download the "core" jar file from [https://jsoup.org/download](https://jsoup.org/download)
* Copy or move the file into the `lib` directory of your project
